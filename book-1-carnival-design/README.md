# Book 1 - Handling the Growth of Carnival

Carnival was able to get by as a bootstrapped startup using Google Sheet and CSV files. However, now that the business model has been proven and the company is growing, it is time to migrate all of the data to a relational database management system (RDBMS) that will store and retrieve the data more efficiently.
