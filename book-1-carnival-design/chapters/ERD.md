# Entity Relationships Diagrams

This chapter will introduce students to an ERD and then how a database diagram is the technical representation of the ERD.

1. Represent an entity
1. Represent a relationship (i.e. cardinality)
1. Represent an attribute

Then show how to create a database diagram using dbdiagram.com for the simple example (TBD).
