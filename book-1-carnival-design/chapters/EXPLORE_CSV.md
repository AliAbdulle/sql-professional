Open the [Carnival Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dJ2EwVk4Y_nx4TzLSaR4UUzX-pdSoKT0C9dwZ4rUTdU/edit?usp=sharing) and make a copy of it for your own use during this course.

## Data Sheets

At the bottom of the spreadsheet, you will see 8 tabs. Each tab contains one kind of data that is being tracked by the dealerships on the Carnival platform.

Explore the data on each of the sheets and be prepared to discuss the different types of data, and write down any questions you have about the data. In the next class, your instructor will answer questions and provide an overview of the structure of the data.
